# Meum intende

Collection of free musical resources for the Czech translation
of the Liturgy of the Hours.

## Authors

I am not their author - my own liturgical music for the same purpose
is in the repository [In adiutorium](https://github.com/igneus/In-adiutorium).
The resources contained here are either public domain
or given to me in order to publish it under some free license.
